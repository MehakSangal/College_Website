     <p float="right">Established in 2002, the Department of Applied Sciences & Humanities, a pioneer department with paramount aim in terms of academic qualifications and achievements of faculty, is an integral part of technical education in AKTU colleges. Each faculty member is a distinguished and venerable in his/her field dedicated to work in a result oriented manner. All the versatile faculty members of the department have commendable and exemplary academic credentials, ample teaching and research experience at senior levels in leading institutions of International repute.
        <br>

        The department offers core courses in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Humanities with technology orientation and perspective added up to enhance analytical capabilities and versatility in the students. Great emphasis is laid to inculcate, in students, the abilities to approach and analyze a new problem in an innovative and logical manner. This helps the students in being better equipped to become technology leaders and innovators.
        <br>
        The experience and assiduousness of the accomplished teachers is very well reflected in consistent and exceptional academic excellence of the students in terms of their performance of students in AKTU examinations and placement as many of our students are placed in the merit list of AKTU Lucknow. Students develop valuable communication skills, explore science and literature and learn to critically examine their society. A sapient and skilled plethora of faculty members ensures mentoring and monitoring of the students for holistic development. The source of knowledge, inspiration and innovation springs from the applied forms of science and humanities, thus the ‘Engineering tree’ can be in its full bloom only by experiencing and incorporating the roots of Applied Sciences.
        <br>
        The highly effective mentoring system of department helps the students to excel academically, personally and professionally.</p>
