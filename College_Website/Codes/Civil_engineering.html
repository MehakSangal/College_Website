            The Department of Civil Engineering was established in the year 2014 with an undergraduate Engineering program in Civil Engineering. Since its inception, the Department has continuously grown and taken initiatives to impart quality education and inculcate research aptitude in Civil Engineering students. In the past six years, the department has seen a lot of progress in academics to enhance knowledge, skills and attitudes in students. This was achievable due to hard working teaching and non-teaching faculty and the support from the generous management. Our infrastructure has been state-of-the-art. The students are groomed with multi-dimensional skill sets covering all the required graduate attributes. Our focus is on practical learning, projects, and research. Students are given sufficient exposure to industry and encouraged to take up projects in this direction.
