    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  The Department of Biotechnology was established in the year 2002 with an undergraduate Engineering program in
        Biotechnology. In the  year 2010, Masters Course in Biotechnology&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was introduced to cater  higher education
        requirements of students. Since its inception, the  Department has continuously grown and taken initiatives to
        impart  quality education and inculcate research aptitude in Biotechnology  students. The department is actively
        engaged in research activities in various areas of Biotechnology and related fields. Major research focus areas
        are herbal cosmetics and medicine, cancer biology, r-DNA Technology and Drug Discovery. The department is also
        an authorized research centre for PhD program through AKTU, Lucknow.
        <br>
        
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our expert faculties in various disciplines also provide research consultancy in Environmental Biotechnology
        with a view to develop practical solutions to environmental problems faced by industries and the municipalities.
        Besides this, other areas such as animal biotechnology, plant biotechnology, microbiology, biochemistry,
        immunology etc are also covered for consultancy and technical support.
        <br>
        <br>
        
       <strong> The students from Biotechnology department are well-placed in different MNC’s and reputed
        government/non-government organizations. The major recruiter’s are-</strong>

        Apart from these, our students are also involved in successful start-ups in Biotechnology product manufacturing/supply. To further promote entrepreneurship in the students we have a Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) supported incubation centre which provides facilities such as funds, space and technical support to deserving start-up projects from students as well as faculties. Many of our meritorious students have got high scores in GATE/GMAT/GRE exams and are pursuing higher studies in reputed universities/Institutes located in India and abroad.
